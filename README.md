## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# YouTube API (Server-side only - do NOT use NEXT_PUBLIC prefix)
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# NextAuth.js
AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Supabase (Public keys work with Row-Level Security)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Production Build

npm run build
npm start
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

## API Keys Setup

### YouTube Data API v3

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the YouTube Data API v3
4. Create credentials (API key)
5. Restrict the API key to YouTube Data API v3
6. Add the key to `.env.local` as `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` (NOT `NEXT_PUBLIC_`)

> **Important**: The YouTube API key is used server-side only to prevent exposure in client bundles.

## Data Storage

Data is stored in Supabase with LocalStorage fallback:
- Video progress and completion status
- Playback settings (speed, dark mode)
- Personal notes with timestamps
- Playlist state and current position

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge: Fully supported
- Firefox: Fully supported
- Safari: Fully supported
- Mobile browsers: Responsive design supported

## Performance

- First load optimized with code splitting
- Lazy loading for YouTube player component
- Throttled LocalStorage writes (1000ms)
- Memoized components for efficient re-renders
- Server-side API caching for YouTube data

## Known Limitations

- YouTube API has daily quota limits (10,000 units/day on free tier)
- LocalStorage has size limits (typically 5-10MB)

## Future Roadmap

- Enhanced gamification features
- Learning streaks and achievements
- Advanced note organization
- Social learning features
